      I am a medical student at the Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand,
      Currently, a member of the Center for Biomedical and Robotics Technology
      at Mahidol University, I am pursuing a master degree in Biomedical Engineering.

      I am naturally curious and constantly broadening my horizon. Among various
      interests, I enjoy learning languages, exploring the world, and meeting people
      across diverse culture. I strongly believe in and advocate for education rights.
      One of my life goals is to make education accessible and fair for everyone.

          The RAMA Open House was a large-scale event. After serving as the co-head in 2021, I reflected on the challenges and areas for improvement. These insights and experience were applied when I led the RAMA Open House 2022, resulting in more efficient management and stronger team coordination.
          - The team structure consisted of 6 teams: Activity, Human Resources and Registration, Document, Art, Technology and Production, and Public Relations teams, totaling over 200 members from multiple class years. Furthermore, the team collaborated with various departments, student clubs, and administrative staff.
          - The key aspects I was responsible for were team coordination, event planning, communication with the public and stakeholders, budgeting, logistics, and problem-solving. The RAMA Open House 2022 was the first on-site event after several years of pause. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional complexities to ensure rigorous health protocols.
          - During RAMA Open House 2022, all 700 available tickets were sold out within one minute. The event received positive feedback and valuable learning points from the participants and staff.

          The RAdiator is an educational platform targeting Thai high school students. We aim to provide free educational resources for university admission preparation. The RAdiator is a collaboration project by the first-year medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital.
          - I worked on the Problem Solving part of the BMAT Section 1 and Physics of Section 2. In addition to teaching, I arranged the material and analyzed past papers to create custom practice problems to reinforce learning. 
          - The core principle I used was making challenging concepts more accessible through clear and intuitive explanations.
          - In total, I produced 10 videos, adding up to about 7 hours, receiving over 30,000 views.

          Since I was young, I have always dreamed of writing my own libraries. Today, I am an active contributor to open source projects. I believe that strong community leads to robust and impactful code.
          - I like optimizing existing ideas and tackling unsolved problems with elegant solutions. I gravitate toward more fundamental libraries that serve as building blocks for scientific research. 
          - My interests are algorithms, science, medical applications, and cryptography. Recently, I took interest in agentic AI. I am open to exploring new fields to enhance multidisciplinary approaches.
          - I code in several languages, but I am most proficient in Python and Rust.
